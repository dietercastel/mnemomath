% Matrix multiplication is like a multi-story-rollercoaster (it makes you feel nausious, you get sweaty at first, the terror comes from within and you're glad when it's all over).
% There are m cars that form an mx1 train on each of the n storys:
% The rollercoaster starts of horizontally, leveled.
% Upon exiting the multi-story building the double seater train has m passengers (numbers); one in each car.
% It starts it first and highest rollercoastercar steeply.
% The highest car falls first, the second next, etc etc. 
% On it's way down, quite suddenly the n trains hit the brakes at the same height. 
% They are now fully vertically suspended noses nearly entering the underground tunnels.
% Suddenly m additional passengers join the original m passengers.
% The trains remaint the same lenght but their weights changed significantly.
% The brakes loose again; the 2m passengers scream.
% After a steep fall the rollercoaster slopes up again to levels corresponding to the story each of the 2m passengers entered the rollercoaster.
% Finally each of the 2m passengers on the n stories get out and hug it out together.
% Lasting bonds are made that day, the terror has passed but n-groups of 2m friends have been made in n-dimensions.
